Topics learnt:

1. document.querySelectorAll returns a 'NodeList' which is not an array but has a few features of an array in the prototype
2. 'change' event listener - triggers the callback function whenever there is a change in the element
3. 'mousemove' event listener - triggers the callback whenever there is a change made in the element using mouse by moving the mouse
4. We can add custom attributes to the input element by prefixing the attributename with 'data'
   Ex: data-sizing= '10px'
5. this.dataset returns the list of custome 'data-' attributes that is given for elements.
